        <p>Either this is the person you think it is or not, 
            what is evident is; this person here likes you. 
            And like he has an issue communicating his feelings, 
            he has used this method to spell out his emotions 
        with the hope that he could do so without concealing his identity 
        or fear of regret.</p>

            next thing you are going to read, but why don't you
