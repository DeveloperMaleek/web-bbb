        <h2>Birdsong</h2>

    <div id="letter">
        <p>Dear <span id="herName">Her name</span>, <br></p>
        <p>I know this is obviously the last thing you'd 
            be expecting from me even that I am unknown till this moment. 
            And I know judging by how short we've been friends, and how 
        usual and random our conversations had been, you may find yourself asking, <em>What's going on with this person?</em></p>

        <p>I must admit that I do not know you, not in the littlest of things. And oftentimes
            I find myself backing out of having solid conversation with you because of me being overly 
            sensitive that I do not want you brooding misconception when we have conversations that are not random. 
        </p>

        <p>
           Before I bore you out with my talk, I want you to know some of us prefer bringing people we adore to 
           our safe space in order to be able to spell out our emotions without feeling
           awkward about it. The truth is, even though I know you perhaps have an idea of who I
           am now which has defeated the purpose of the safe space, I still feel secured 
           telling you this here behind this curtain that'd soon be rolled over.
        </p>

        <p>
            I know we are friends (or maybe I am overthinking this), but I want us to be more. 
            This may seem surprising to you, but some things are beyond us as human. And as much
            as I want to prolong this, to be certain if this is me experiencing this feeling in its purest
            state, but I do not have that luxury to wait. I have felt the brunch of waiting, that I'd learnt 
            to choose rejection over regret.
        </p>

        <p>
            I know the world is not fair. I understand its intricacies. I understand that we may not be on the
            same page. And I understand that this may be of suprise to you and as well evoke a gentle fury in you. And I'll 
            clearly understand if you let this slide and pretend nothing happened, or if you choose the other way to say,
            <em>we don't need to have anything more than friendship.</em> Trust me, whatever you choose to do, it will not 
            change the friendship we are building.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm shy, and if I have not tried to find a safe space like this, I am obviously not going to 
            send this, and perhaps wait till someday that this feeling overgrows me before I write them out
            in fluffy words that wouldn't hold any water again. Beyond sending Birdsong as just a letter, I have 
            embodied it in a language (programming) I had always failed at comprehending. I know effort like this may be minute,
            or seems like a showoff, but if you end up reading this letter, I want you to know that the zeal to pickup learning
            programming again came as a result of me wanting to start something great with you in a different way.
            I could have sent this Birdsong letter as a usual letter, but I am shy, and I wanted to send you this while
            I am offline wasting away somewhere hoping you'd come to make the half full again.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            lastly, <span id="herNameTwo"></span>, maybe this is a formal request, I do not know, but I wish I can 
            come onboard of your growth process, as I will anticipate you come onboard of mine also. I could write 
            continuously to keep convincing you of how much I would cherish and nurture what we would have, but also,
            I do not want to get carried away that I end up putting fluffy words that would water down this letter.
            Birdsongs are meant to be sweet and sonorous, and so is what I have intended with this letter. I cannot tell 
            if you smiled after reading this or not, but I smiled while writing it.  I believe great things start small and require time and patience. And I am positive we can work this out
            like the twinkle twinkle little stars.
        </p>
        <p>
             I do not know what your response is going to be like, but there are two buttons after this Birdsong. the blue
             button will clear your curiosity on who this is and may be an indication of positive great beginning between us, while the
             red button may mean, perhaps we do not need to have anything except friendship. Regardless of your response, I'll
             still be a friend who will be concerned about you and your growth.  
        </p>
